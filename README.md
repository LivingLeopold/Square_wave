# Square_wave
Write a function called square_wave that computes the sum

for  each  of  1001  values  of  t  uniformly  spaced  from  0  to  4π  inclusive.  
The  input  argument  is  a positive scalar integer n, and the output argument is a row vector of 1001 such sums—one sum for each value of t. You can test your function by calling it with n == 200 or greater and plotting the result, and you will see why the function is called “square_wave”.
